# Output files

This directory contains several output files from the analysis, as described below.

### Proteobacteria phylogeny
- MLSA_alignment.fasta: A file containing the trimmed alignment (in fasta format) used to construct a phylogeny of the phylum Proteobacteria.
- MLSA_phylogeny.tre: The RAxML phylogeny of the phylum Proteobacteria, as presented in Figures 1 and S1.
- MLSA_phylogeny_annotation.txt: The annotation file used for colour-coding the taxa in phylogenies of Figures 1 and S1.
- Metadata.xlsx: An Excel file containing metadata of the proteobacterial proteomes analyzed in this study.

### Flagellin phylogeny
- Flagellin_proteins.fasta: A multifasta file containing the amino acid sequences of all of the flagellin proteins identified in the phylum Proteobacteria.
- Flagellin_alignment.fasta: A file containing the trimmed alignment (in fasta format) used to construct a phylogeny of flagellin proteins.
- Flagellin_phylogeny.tre: The RAxML phylogeny of the full set of flagellin proteins, as presented in Figure S2.

### Flg22 amino acid sequences
