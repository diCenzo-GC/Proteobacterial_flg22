# Proteobacterial_flg22
 
 Preprint coming soon.
 
 This repository contains a set of scripts used to perform the flg22 analyses (from flagellin collection through to phylogeny construction) reported in the above paper. The entire pipeline can be run by running the overall_workflow.sh script. If you use adaptations of any of these scripts or pipelines as part of your work, please cite our article.
